Samples of spin Hamiltonians
****************************

This repository contains a set of files with the spin Hamiltonians in the magnopy's
format.

Rules
=====

- The hame of the file must start with the index, followed by "_", and then arbitrary
  text.
- The index must be a number.
- Hamiltonian's name in the text format should end with ".txt".
- Hamiltonian's name in the binary (hdf5) format should end with ".hdf5".

I.e. "1_*.txt" and "1_*.hdf5" are valid names.

Adding new Hamiltonians
=======================

To add a new Hamiltonian open a pull request.
